    "- You may call forageBot.explore() and forageBot.forage() a combined total of 5000 times. Weather can change every day, and the day passes immediately after exploring or foraging.\n",
    "- You may sell() as often as you want. Take weekday prices into account. The first day is Monday.\n",
    "- ForageBot.reset_days() MUST be called in the first AND ONLY THE FIRST line of your solution.\n",
    "- You MAY NOT use any of the pre_survey trees and bushes, nor may you use trees or bushes you have discovered previously. You can only forage things you have found within the 5000 days.\n",
    "- You MAY NOT directly modify any things you can find in forage_bot.py, such as manually creating trees or messing with sales prices, etc.\n",
    "- You MAY NOT use additional imports in the solution you submit. You may use libraries imported at the beginning, such as numpy.\n",
    "- You may hardcode parameters that you may have discovered while using additional libraries such as sklearn, as long as those are no longer imported and required for the solution.\n",
    "- We may test your solution with a different random seed if the solution seems to rely on something that can only happen in the chosen seed. In that case, you will receive gold if your solution passes at least a quarter of all seeds.\n",
